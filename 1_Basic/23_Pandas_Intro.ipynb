It's like a column in a spreadsheet.\n","    * **DataFrame**: A two-dimensional, mutable table with labeled axes (rows and columns). It resembles a spreadsheet or SQL table and can contain multiple Series objects of different data types.\n","\n","### Importance\n","\n","* Pandas is one of the most popular and most used library for working with data is Pandas.\n","* It provides functions for data manipulation, from simple data aggregation to complex merging and joining of datasets.\n","* Lets us analyze big data and use statistics.\n","* Works well with other Python libraries, enhancing its functionality for numerical computations and visualizations.\n","\n","### Import\n","\n","* First before we even use the library we have to load it in our environment and import it using the `import` command.\n","* Also once we import it we are going to rename it to `pd`, which is a common alias we give a library. It makes it easier to type out instead of having to type out `pandas` every time. It's technically optional, but it is convention to do this."],"metadata":{"id":"pWo3Z-Lj2iDb"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":9,"metadata":{"id":"nBgrehy5yjte","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1757495636423,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":4,"user":{"displayName":"Wende Zhou","userId":"15441026311543276223"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Loading Data\n","\n","### Notes\n","\n","- We can load data from a CSV using `pd.read_csv()`\n","- We can also load data from an Excel file using `pd.read_excel()`"],"metadata":{"id":"vcPqRCxt3bV2"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# pd.read_csv('path_to_file.csv')"],"metadata":{"id":"SDJm1etO3aAc","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1757495636427,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":1,"user":{"displayName":"Wende Zhou","userId":"15441026311543276223"}}},"execution_count":10,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# pd.read_excel('path_to_file.xlsx')"],"metadata":{"id":"Jt6WLrRv3fLM","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1757495636444,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":1,"user":{"displayName":"Wende Zhou","userId":"15441026311543276223"}}},"execution_count":11,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from datasets import load_dataset\n","\n","# Loading Data\n","dataset = load_dataset('lukebarousse/data_jobs')\n","df = dataset['train'].to_pandas()"],"metadata":{"id":"A27oNwLC3kI3","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1757495640989,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":4544,"user":{"displayName":"Wende Zhou","userId":"15441026311543276223"}}},"execution_count":12,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Note:** For the rest of the sections in this course we'll be doing some exploratory data analysis (EDA) to learn more about the dataset we have.
